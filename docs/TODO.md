# TODO List
These are tasks yet to be done. Work on them from top to bottom, confirm when you start working on one and are finished. I'll tell you if you've completed it and only then will you remove it from the list.

Slides, and their associated transitions, should be able to be used without a Deck.

Are Decks too special? Should more of the resolving and animation logic be moved into Slide?
